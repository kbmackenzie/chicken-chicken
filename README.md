You can pipe output from `chicken-chicken` into Node.js to execute it directly:

```bash
chicken-chicken 'hello.chicken' | node
# prints: Hello world
```

You can also embed the generated JavaScript into a `<script>` tag in an HTML file with no issue:

```bash
# Compile with a global export:
chicken-chicken hello.chicken --global -o hello.js
```

```html
<!-- Include in HTML file: -->
<script src="hello.js"></script>
```

- It compiles Chicken source code to ES2016-compliant JavaScript, which can run anywhere.
- No parsing occurs at runtime. Very fast.
- It tries to be as compliant with the language specification as possible.

## Building From Source

**Note:** The instructions below are written with Linux in mind. Building this project on Windows requires a [make][4] implementation **and** a POSIX-compliant shell.

To build `chicken-chicken` from source, you're gonna need:

- The [CHICKEN Scheme][1] binariesâ€”preferably version 5.4.0 or higher.
- [Node.js][5] and [NPM][6].

You can build it using [make][4] or [HenHen][3].

### Make

To install the necessary CHICKEN dependencies, build the `chicken-chicken` binary and install it to `~/.local/bin`, run:

```bash
make install
```

To install `chicken-chicken` somewhere else instead (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`), just define PREFIX:

```bash
make PREFIX=/usr/local/bin install
```

### HenHen

To build this project in an isolated environment using [HenHen][3], just run:

```bash
henhen run make
```

To install the `chicken-chicken` binary to `~/.local/bin`, run:

```bash
henhen run install
```
